## 🧪 The Process

I started by preparing and training a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes.  
After experimenting with different approaches, I selected and saved the best-performing model.

Next, I focused on building the backend logic that loads the trained model and exposes a prediction endpoint.  
This step helped me understand how ML models are used in real applications rather than standalone notebooks.

Once the backend was functional, I created a simple frontend to collect user input and display predictions.  
The goal was clarity and functionality rather than complex UI design.

Throughout the project, I tested each component separately before connecting everything together.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how machine learning projects are structured beyond model training.

### 🧠 Machine Learning
- Training and saving ML models
- Evaluating model performance
- Understanding feature importance and data flow

### 🔗 Backend & Integration
- Loading ML models in a backend environment
- Handling prediction requests through an API
- Connecting backend logic with frontend input

### 🌐 Web Development
- Sending data from the frontend to the backend
- Handling responses and displaying results
- Structuring a simple but functional UI

### 🧩 Overall Growth
This project improved my problem-solving skills and helped me better understand how data science and web development intersect in real-world applications.
